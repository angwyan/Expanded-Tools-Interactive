				&nbsp;&nbsp;After the founding of New China, pandas were valued and protected in China. Then, with the increasing scientific and specific protection measures, the number of pandas has increased significantly. And it is regarded as a national treasure animal. As a signature animal of the Chinese image brand. Because the panda is a rare animal unique to China. In the natural environment rule and survival competition, most animals are extinct, but the panda has survived. Moreover, the mild character represents China’s willingness to yearn for peace. The idea of "peace" in China is reflected in the black and white fur of the pandas. Because of the combination of black and white, it represents an important meaning in Chinese philosophy. For example, the Chinese Taiji, black and white, symbolizes balance and matches with the traditional Chinese philosophy. It is more helpful to let the people of the world understand China<br />

Including the establishment of the Panda Sanctuary. Create a website about panda information, such as the "chinagiantpanda" website. The website comprehensively introduces the protection of pandas, the main Panda Sanctuary and the Panda Conservation Research Institute, which records the location and time of the pandas found in the wild and how to protect the pandas. It also focused on the field tracking of panda activities and panda volunteer activities. There are also have Panda live video, Panda Games, etc. Many local companies and brands are named after the panda. Includes logo, including products.

It can be seen that the panda can obtain such successful protection, except that because it is a rare animal, one of the important reasons is that the panda represents the image of China and the local.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;Panda data collection<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;eMammal is a system for collecting, storing and sharing camera trap data. The system is designed for scientists and citizen scientists and anyone who wants to join the camera trap for fun and discovery. Citizen volunteers place "camera traps", infrared activated cameras in the landscape of parks and other natural areas to collect photos of mammals. Camera captures then use our custom software to view images, identify animals, and upload them to a data repository for viewing and storage. These data help researchers and scientists study and protect animals better. “eMammal is at the cutting edge intersection of the new technologies surrounding cloud computing and “big data” and the time honored tradition of citizens volunteering to help conservation efforts,” said Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute Conservation Biologist, Tavis Forrester, Ph.D.<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panda Project aims to determine the distribution of pandas and other large mammal species in and around the Panda Nature Reserve and to help local protected areas establish a large panda monitoring system that uses camera trapping. These data help researchers answer questions about the regional distribution and latitude of pandas and use this information to protect pandas. They also provide a unique perspective on the hidden wildlife world.<br />
